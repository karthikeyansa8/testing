"""Question 2 — Prime Synchronization Grid
Title: Minimum Operations to Synchronize Grid
Description:
You are given an N × N grid.
One move = increment entire row or entire column by 1.
Goal: After some moves:

Every row sum must be prime
Every column sum must be prime
Use minimum moves
Conditions:
1 ≤ N ≤ 600
Values: 0 to 1,000,000
Must compute next primes efficiently
Brute-force is impossible for large N
Sample Input:
2
1 2
3 4
Sample Output:
3"""
